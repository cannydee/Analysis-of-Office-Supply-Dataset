# Office-Supply-Dashboard
The Office Supply Dashboard for Dataleum

From the office supply dataset given which constituted of columns; Segment, State, Product, Units sold, Manufacturing cost, Sales price, etc, I computed calculated columns on Microsoft Power Bi such as the Gross sales, Discount using the discount rate, Revenue, Profit before and after tax, Profit margin, Tax on profit using a tax rate of 5%.

Power BI is an interactive data-visualization software product developed by Microsoft with a primary focus on business intelligence. it is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.

After importing the data and adding new calculated columns into Power Bi, I created a new table for the calendar year and modelled the data to show relationships between the original data and calendar tables. I calculated measures for the totals of each financial column; the card visual was used to show the values of the computed measures.

I created a report overview for Segment, State, and Product against Total cost, Revenue, Sales, and Profit using the clustered column chart and pie chart visuals. The trend analysis of units sold, total revenue, and profits for the year 2014 as well as quarter 4 of years 2013 and 2014 of all products were computed, using State as a slicer. I inserted textboxes to add titles for each report page, buttons to add reset icons, as well as the company image icon.

The products' performance by tax for each state and government was determined. Some of the key findings included; the total profit by product indicated products' biro and pencil made profits when compared to the total manufacturing cost, while products markers, notepad and stapler did not yield any profits. Other key findings were summarised in the full project as seen in the link attached.

One of the recommendations given was for the Segments to manufacture more of the key products identified to help increase sales and total revenue.
